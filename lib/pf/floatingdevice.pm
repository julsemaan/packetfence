=head1 NAME

pf::floatingdevice - module to manage the floating network devices.

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

pf::floatingdevice contains the functions necessary to manage the floating network devices.
A floating network device is a device that PacketFence does not manage as a regular device.

This code was originally added to support mobile Access Points. 
When an AP is plugged, PacketFence should:

=over

=item - let/allow all the MAC addresses that will be connected to the AP (disable mac-notifications and port-security traps)

=item - configure the port as multi-vlan (trunk) and set PVID and tagged VLANs on the port

=back

When an AP us unplugged, PacketFence should reconfigure the port like before the AP was plugged

In order to simplify things at first, we decided that 
FLOATING NETWORK DEVICES SHOULD ONLY BE PLUGGED IN PORT CONFIGURED WITH PORT_SECURITY!

Here is how it works:

=over

=item - floating network devices have to be identified using their MAC address (in conf/floating_network_device.conf)

=item - linkup/linkdown traps are not enabled on the switches, only port-security traps are.

=item - when PF receives a port-security violation trap, it checks if the device is a floating network device. if so, 
PF changes the port configuration so that:

=over 

=item - it disables port-security

=item - it sets the PVID

=item - it eventually sets the port as multi-vlan (trunk) and sets the tagged Vlans 

=item - it enables linkdown traps

=back

=item - when PF receives a linkdown trap, it checks if the last device plugged is a floating network device. If so,
 PF changes the port configuration so that: 

=over

=item - it enables port-security

=item - it disables linkdown traps

=back

=back

=over

Get an instance of the pf::floatingdevice object

Change port configuration to disable port-security, set PVID and set port as multi-vlan if necessary
